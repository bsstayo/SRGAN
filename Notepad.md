I have no idea why my code doesn't run in professor's notebook, now I find the reason!<br>
CUDA version was not satisfied, I installed 10.1, but the right version was 10.0<br>

I can get another step of my code.<br>
It seems much better than previous results.<br>
However, it takes much longer time, so I think I have to wait for it with patience.<br>

FINALLY!!! Finish to run 'model.py'.<br>
But cannot run evaluate mode, because of my GPU's memory is too small.<br>
I should resize the input value.<br>
